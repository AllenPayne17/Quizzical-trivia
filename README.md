## About This project:
This is my final Solo Project of Bob Ziroll's React Course on Scrimba. My task was to create a dynamic website for a quiz game using OpenTrivia API, and publish it on the open source platform. I used my knowledge about React, component interactions, state handling, fetching data through APIs, and Sass to assemble the final project. This is a responsive website which means it will display correctly on any device with various widths and heights.
